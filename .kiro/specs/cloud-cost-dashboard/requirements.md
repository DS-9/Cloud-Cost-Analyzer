# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This web application serves as a comprehensive cloud cost optimization platform designed for cloud platform administrators, CFOs, and Chief Data Officers. The application provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and analyze cloud resource cost and usage data across both Azure and AWS platforms, helping organizations identify cost optimization opportunities based on usage patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cloud platform administrator, I want to view comprehensive cost and usage data for both Azure and AWS resources, so that I can monitor and manage our multi-cloud infrastructure effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display cost and usage data for both Azure and AWS platforms
2. WHEN the administrator selects a specific cloud platform THEN the system SHALL filter and display platform-specific resource data
3. WHEN the administrator views resource data THEN the system SHALL present information in clearly labeled sections with explanatory tooltips

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CFO or Chief Data Officer, I want to see business-focused cost insights and optimization opportunities, so that I can make informed financial decisions about our cloud spending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a business user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL present cost data in business-friendly visualizations and summaries
2. WHEN viewing cost data THEN the system SHALL highlight potential savings opportunities based on usage patterns
3. WHEN examining cost trends THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of metrics without requiring technical expertise
### 
Requirement 3

**User Story:** As any user of the system, I want a modular and intuitive interface with clearly labeled sections, so that I can easily navigate and understand the different aspects of cloud cost management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL display a structured layout with distinct panels or cards for different functionalities
2. WHEN viewing any section THEN the system SHALL provide clear section titles such as "Resource Usage Overview", "Cost Summary", and "Savings Opportunities"
3. WHEN interacting with metrics or visualizations THEN the system SHALL provide tooltips or inline descriptions to explain their meaning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be built with a flexible and expandable architecture, so that we can easily add new features, resource types, and data sources as our needs evolve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new resource types are added THEN the system SHALL accommodate them without requiring major architectural changes
2. WHEN the layout needs to be rearranged THEN the system SHALL allow modifications without breaking core functionality
3. WHEN additional cloud platforms need to be supported THEN the system SHALL provide a framework for easy integration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on this application, I want to use modern web technologies and frameworks, so that the application is maintainable, performant, and follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the frontend THEN the system SHALL use React with Vite for optimal development experience and performance
2. WHEN implementing the backend THEN the system SHALL use Python with FastAPI for robust API development
3. WHEN managing the application THEN the system SHALL use Node.js for build tools and package management
4. WHEN developing with mock data THEN the system SHALL structure data models to easily transition to real API integration

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user analyzing cloud costs, I want to see different types of data visualizations and analysis tools, so that I can understand cost patterns and usage trends from multiple perspectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing cost data THEN the system SHALL provide multiple visualization types including charts, graphs, and tabular data
2. WHEN analyzing usage patterns THEN the system SHALL display time-based trends and comparisons
3. WHEN examining resource utilization THEN the system SHALL show both current status and historical patterns
4. WHEN identifying cost optimization opportunities THEN the system SHALL present data in formats suitable for both technical and business audiences
